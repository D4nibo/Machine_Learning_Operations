# Machine Learning Operations - Lab assignments

## About

This repository contains the lab assignments for the course Machine Learning Operations, which was part of the [Bachelor Applied Computer Science programme](https://www.hogent.be/en/future-student/bachelors/applied-information-technology/) at [HOGENT](https://www.hogent.be/), during academic year 2023-2024

The goal of these assignments were to get familiar with concepts like container virtualization, CI/CD, monitoring, etc. in the context of Machine Learning Operations.

This repository contains some scaffolding code, based on [ansible-skeleton](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-skeleton), a framework for quickly setting up an Ansible development and testing environment powered by [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

## Content

The content of each lab is the following:

1. [Docker revisited](assignments/1_Docker-Revisited/)
2. [Continuous Integration/Delivery with GitHub Actions](assignments/2_CI-CD/)
3. [The ML Workflow](assignments/3_ML-Workflow/)
4. [Container orchestration with Kubernetes](assignments/4_Kubernetes/)
5. [Quantization and pruning](assignments/5_Quantization-and-pruning/)
6. [Monitoring and alerting](assignments/6_Monitoring-and-alerting/)

Each lab contains the assignment itself, a lab report and additionnal files which are part of the assignment
