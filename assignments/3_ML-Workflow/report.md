# Lab Report: The ML Workflow

## Assignment description

A ML model is just a small part of a ML-solution. There is a lot more around it like monitoring, CD/CI, testing, etc. ML-ops are the people responsbile of this. The goal of this lab was to see how ML-ops works, and more precisely how to set up a ML-workflow. The technologie used was Azure.

## Proof of work done

- After having installed the prerequesites, I execetued the code that creates the dataset. This created training, validation, and test sets:

- After that, I executed the code for preprocessing, building the model, training the model and evaluating the model. I thereafter executed the code to create a workspace. This was created succesfully

- The different components where build, and the pipeline was succesuflly created
